Conway's Life for NES
============

These are two implementations of Conway's Life for the NES: a 32x32 grid version and a 64x32 grid version.
The 64x32 grid was included on the Double Action 53 multicart and has more features than the 32x32 version but is slower.

An emulator with unofficial opcode support is required to run these programs.
cc65 is required to assemble them.

# Build an `.nes` file

To build a `.nes` file, run either the `mk32.bat` or `mk64.bat` file in this folder, depending on the grid size you desire.
